# Meditative graphics for a Carlo Acutis novena

Inkscape / G'MIC day-by-day graphics in this repository were created to illustrate [this Carlo Acutis french-speaking novena on Hozana.org in October 2020](https://hozana.org/publication/99504-neuvieme-jour-le-raccourci-infaillible).

Pure copyleft

Original images were grabbed from the Internet and tuned, in order to help spend 9 days of meditation with this young man, in french for now.
Most of them probably come from [carloacutis.com](carloacutis.com).

Carlo's quotes in french come [from this website](https://www.evangelium-vitae.org/actualite/3340/carlo-acutis--citations.htm).

Given that Carlo is now somewhere in Heaven and on Earth, who knows exactly and assuming that Carlo's family do want Carlo's story and life to be known widely, supposition is done that noone will claim rights for Carlo's childhood images and thus also for the derivatives created here.

Carlo Acutis (1991-2005) from Italy, brought and will bring much inspiration to truth seekers, computer scientists and teens. He died aged 15 of agressive leukemia. Dead people healing living people is too scarce in this world not to be mentioned (cf. [the young Mattheus case in Brasil, 2013](https://www.ncregister.com/news/the-miracle-attributed-to-carlo-acutis-prayers)).
